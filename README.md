## üåü Key Features

### Intention Broadcasting
- **Dynamic Path Planning**: Real-time path generation and adjustment
- **Confidence-based Decision Making**: Path confidence calculation and conflict resolution
- **Emergency Route Planning**: Automatic generation of emergency escape routes

### Mesh Networking
- **Dynamic Network Formation**: Adaptive mesh network connections
- **Network Health Monitoring**: Real-time connectivity and density metrics
- **Priority-based Communication**: Multi-level priority system for message handling

### Advanced Analytics
- **Real-time Metrics**: Comprehensive system performance monitoring
- **Network Analysis**: Detailed mesh network statistics
- **Conflict Detection**: Sophisticated collision risk assessment
- **Visual Analytics**: Rich visualization of system dynamics

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
cd intention-broadcast-system

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the package
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from ibs.network import IntentionBroadcastSimulation

# Create and run a simulation
sim = IntentionBroadcastSimulation(space_size=(50, 50, 30))
sim.run()
```

## üéÆ Advanced Usage

### Custom Network Configuration

```python
from ibs.network import IntentionBroadcastNetwork
import numpy as np

# Initialize the network
network = IntentionBroadcastNetwork(space_size=(50, 50, 30))

# Configure network parameters
network.broadcast_interval = 0.5
network.mesh_range = 15.0
network.collision_threshold = 5.0

# Add drones with priorities
network.add_drone(
    drone_id="emergency_1",
    position=np.array([10, 10, 5]),
    goal=np.array([40, 40, 25]),
    priority_level="emergency"
)
```

### Priority Level Configuration

```python
# Define custom priority levels
priority_config = {
    'emergency': 5,
    'medical': 4,
    'express': 3,
    'standard': 2,
    'flexible': 1
}

network = IntentionBroadcastNetwork(
    space_size=(50, 50, 30),
    priority_levels=priority_config
)
```
